### [Hello there](https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc?t=8) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wridgeu/wridgeu/master/pictures/wave.gif" width="20px" height="20px">

My name is Marco 👋 

I mostly do [ABAP](https://se38.myspreadshop.de/abaps+not+dead-A5d82e004b264a16d3e4142ed?productType=812) development in my regular job but love spending my free time on OSS, Web Development and lots of other interesting things and technologies. I also enjoy code reviews as well as talking about code and how to improve on it, so don't be afraid to message me. 🎤🐛 I'm open for any kind of feedback and always willing to learn & improve. Even more so since I'm completely self-taught in basically everything I do. 😶‍🌫️

I also love helping and teaching others, that is ... as far as I can. ☺️

  <div>
    Old notes from learning Web Development, or more specific, UI5 back around in 2020-2021. They're not updated anymore as the overall <a href="https://ui5.sap.com/">documentation of UI5</a> and it's <a href="https://github.com/ui5-community">ecosystem</a> has evolved a <em>lot</em>. I strongly recommend and encourage checking out the <a href="https://ui5.sap.com/">docs</a> to get started! Nowadays the "Wiki" is mostly used as playground for it's integration into my <a href="https://wridgeu.github.io/">personal page</a>.
